Very simple Markdown alternative.

It enchances otherwise plain text files with a few syntax extensions for:

* paragraphs
* inline code snippets
* definitions (like in &lt;dl&gt; element)
* comments/asides (originally intended as collapsible paragraphs)
* source code highlighting
* footnotes

It's virtues are that it's very small (~130 loc) and very focused on producing 
posts for programming blogs. It's killer feature is out-of-the-box support for
syntax highlighting of any language supported by Pygments.

Sample input in test.txt and output in test.html.
